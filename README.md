# Visualizing Music: Exploring the Relationship Between Musical Features and Mental Imagery

## Project Overview
This project explores how music-evoked mental images can be transformed into visual representations generated from acoustic features of real musical excerpts.
The long-term goal is to investigate whether such visual feedback could help people with hearing impairments experience the emotional and structural qualities of music through vision.

## Background and Theoretical Framework
The project basis will be created combining insights from:
- Dahl, Stella & Bjørner (2023), who studied how people imagine visual scenes when listening to music
- Haumann et al. (2018, 2021), who analyzed which acoustic features elicit perceptual and cortical responses during music listening
