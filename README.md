# Visualizing Music: Exploring the Relationship Between Musical Features and Mental Imagery

## Project Overview
This project explores how music-evoked mental images can be transformed into visual representations generated from acoustic features of real musical excerpts.
The long-term goal is to investigate whether such visual feedback could help people with hearing impairments experience the emotional and structural qualities of music through vision.

The project basis will be created combining insights from:
- Dahl, Stella & Bjørner (2023), who studied how people imagine visual scenes when listening to music, and
- Haumann et al. (2018, 2021), who analyzed which acoustic features elicit perceptual and cortical responses during music listening.

Therefore, this project connects subjective imagery with objective sound analysis, turning musical parameters into dynamic visual cues.

## Conceptual Framework

---
## Research Questions & Hypotheses
Main Hypothesis: Visuals whose parameters vary with key musical features will evoke emotional impressions similar to those experienced when listening to the music, suggesting a potential pathway for conveying musical affect to hearing-impaired individuals.
